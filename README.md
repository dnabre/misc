Random code that's being throw out there in case others might it useful. 
Most of these are proof of concept or basic demo-type stuff to show how something is done. 
Don't expect it to be polished, complete, or commented. 
Makefile's are generally quickly throw together show messes just to make sure that people can see how to build the code (what flags extra).
